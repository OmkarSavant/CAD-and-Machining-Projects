# See Work Here:
This contains files for some of my personal CAD and Machining projects. 

Stirling Engine: I designed parts for and assembled a moving Stirling Heat engine. Based on these designs, I machined the parts to build a working engine that had a max speed of 1516 RPM.

Testing reveals that the mount significantly decreased high frequency oscillation:
